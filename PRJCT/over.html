<p>Abdul Rashid Salim Salman Khan (pronounced [s?l'ma?n 'xa?n]; born 27 December 1965)[4] is an Indian film actor, producer, occasional singer and television personality. In a film career spanning over thirty years, Khan has received numerous awards, including two National Film Awards as a film producer, and two Filmfare Awards for acting.[5] He has a significant following in Asia and the Indian diaspora worldwide,[6][better source needed] and is cited in the media as one of the most commercially successful actors of both world and Indian cinema.[7][8] According to the Forbes 2018 list of Top-Paid 100 Celebrity Entertainers in world, Khan was the highest ranked Indian with 82nd rank with earnings of $37.7 million.[9][10] He is also known as the host of the reality show, Bigg Boss since 2010.[11]

The eldest son of screenwriter Salim Khan, Khan began his acting career with a supporting role in Biwi Ho To Aisi (1988), followed by a leading role in Maine Pyar Kiya (1989). Khan continued in Bollywood in the 1990s with roles in several productions, including the romantic drama Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! (1994), the action thriller Karan Arjun (1995), the comedy Biwi No.1 (1999), and the family drama Hum Saath-Saath Hain (1999). After a brief period of decline in the 2000s, Khan achieved greater stardom in the 2010s by playing the lead role in successful films Dabangg (2010), Ready (2011), Ek Tha Tiger (2012), Kick (2014), Sultan (2016) and Tiger Zinda Hai (2017). Forbes included him in their 2015 list of Top-Paid 100 Celebrity Entertainers in world; Khan tied with Amitabh Bachchan for No. 71 on the list, both with earnings of $33.5 million.[12][13]

In addition to his acting career, Khan is a television presenter and promotes humanitarian causes through his charity, Being Human Foundation.[14] Khan's off-screen life is marred by controversy and legal troubles. In 2015 he was convicted of culpable homicide for a negligent driving case in which he ran over five people with his car, killing one, but his conviction was set aside on appeal.[15][16][17][18] On 5 April 2018, Khan was convicted in a blackbuck poaching case and sentenced to five years imprisonment.[19][20] He is currently out on bail while an appeal is being heard.[citation needed]</p>
