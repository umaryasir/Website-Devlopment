<p>Engineering education is the activity of teaching knowledge and principles to the professional practice of engineering. It includes an initial education (bachelor's and/or master's degree), and any advanced education and specializations that follow. Engineering education is typically accompanied by additional postgraduate examinations and supervised training as the requirements for a professional engineering license. The length of education, and training to qualify as a basic professional engineer, is typically 8–12 years, with 15–20 years for an engineer who takes responsibility for major projects.

Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education in primary and secondary schools often serves as the foundation for engineering education at the university level.[1] In the United States, engineering education is a part of the STEM initiative in public schools.[2] Service-learning in engineering education is gaining popularity within the variety of disciplinary focuses within engineering education including chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, industrial engineering, computer engineering, electrical engineering, and other engineering education.</p>
