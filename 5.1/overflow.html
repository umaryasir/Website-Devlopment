<p>These are exciting times in the programming languages community
with each of the major languages striving to keep pace with
compelling new programming technologies. In the three decades of
C++’s development prior to 2011, only a few new versions of the
language were released. Now the ISO C++ Standards Committee is
committed to releasing a new standard every three years and the
compiler vendors are building in the new features promptly. C++ How
to Program, 10/e is based on the C++11 and C++14 standards
published in 2011 and 2014, respectively. C++17 is already under
active development. Throughout the book, C++11 and C++14 features
are marked with the “11” and “14” icons, respectively, that you see
here in the margin. Fig. 1 lists the book’s first references to the 77
C++11 and C++14 features we discuss.
